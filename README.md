*Static HTML/JS/CSS Site for a Click-through Splash Page*

## Overview
Cisco Meraki provides cloud managed WiFi with the ability to host your own "Splash Page", which is a captive portal service for authenticating users to join the network. This concept is called an External Captive Portal (ExCaP). 

Meraki provides two splash page modes, **click-through** and **sign-on**. This application will use the click-through method.

Just host these files in the public directory on any web server such as Apache or Firebase Hosting, configure your Meraki SSID to use your server and that's it!

This version posts the form data to a Zapier webhook and is required for operation. 




### Sample URL received from Meraki to this page.
*You can use this URL to test your application without an access point*
```
http://localhost/?base_grant_url=https%3A%2F%2Fn143.network-auth.com%2Fsplash%2Fgrant&user_continue_url=http%3A%2F%2Fspeedof.me%2F&node_id=149624922840090&node_mac=88:15:44:60:1c:1a&gateway_id=149624922840090&client_ip=10.255.60.208&client_mac=f4:5c:89:9b:17:67
